- 👋 Hi, I’m @FutureProofHomes
- 👀 I’m interested in building smart homes with the Home Assistant platform
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to leverage LLMs to build 100% local and privacy-centric smart home voice assistants.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on home assistant scripts, hacks, blueprints, esp32 builds, node red flows, automations, LLM models & prompts.
